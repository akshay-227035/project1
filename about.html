                About 
                The company was founded by AKSHAY from Chatteris in 1987 as City Centre Restaurants plc with the objective of owning and managing the Garfunkel's Restaurant chain.[3] In the late 1980s, the company bought the Mexican foodchain Chi Chi's and renamed it Chiquito.[3] Then, in 1995, it opened its first Frankie & Benny's in Leicester.[3]

In January 2004, the company changed its name to The Restaurant Group plc.[4] In February 2004, it made an unsuccessful bid for Ask Central plc,[5] and in 2006, it bought back the Deep Pan Pizza chain, which it had previously sold to the management.[6] In 2016, the company announced it was closing 33 restaurants due to falling sales and profits.[7]

In 2018, The Restaurant Group purchased noodle chain Wagamama for £559m, to diversify its portfolio.[8]

In May 2018, the Brunning & Price division purchased the Ribble Valley Inns, a collection of restaurant and real ale pubs in the north of England, from the Northcote Group for an undisclosed sum;[9] and in August 2018, the division purchased the 11-strong portfolio of Food & Fuel Pubs, which included two Coco Momo wine bars, for £15.4 million.[10]

On 3 June 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, The Restaurant Group told employees a "large number" of its outlets would not reopen after lockdown;[11] up to 120 restaurants, mainly Frankie & Benny's, were set to close permanently,[12] with the loss of between 2,000 and 3,000 jobs.[13] On 8 June, The Restaurant Group said it was in discussions with its landlords about potential restructuring options,[13] and three days later announced it had entered a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) and planned to cut 125 sites.[14]

In October 2020 the business suffered a significant shareholder revolt over the proposed pay package of its chief executive, Andy Hornby. After a year involving over 4,000 job losses and approximately 230 restaurant closures more than a third of investors opposed the package</div>
